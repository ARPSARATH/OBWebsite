## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Animations not working
**Solution:** Ensure `initializeHomeAnimations()` is called after DOM is ready

### Issue: Map not displaying
**Solution:** Check that `loadTamilNaduMap()` is executing and SVG is being injected

### Issue: Counters not animating
**Solution:** Verify Intersection Observer is supported and `data-target` attributes are set

### Issue: Horizontal scroll not working
**Solution:** Check that wheel event listener is attached to `.horizontal-scroll-container`
